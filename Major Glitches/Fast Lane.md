[section=Description]

Fast Lane is an application of the [Anywhere Menu Glitch](d4jq8) (AMG) that allows you to Return to the Ebon Hawk from anywhere at anytime.  This works in places where such transit is usually impossible, if your party is scattered, and even during cutscenes or combat.

[section=How To]

To perform a Fast Lane, you must first have a manual save, saved in an area where it is possible to return to either the Hideout or the Ebon Hawk (called the Transit Save).  Then perform the following steps:

1. Quick Save your game.
2. Load the Transit Save manually.
3. Activate [AMG](d4jq8) during the loading screen for the Transit Save.
4. Unpause the game and open the Map Screen.
5. Click "Return to Hideout" (or "Return to Ebon Hawk"), then close the menu.
6. Quick Load your game.
7. Select "OK" to transit.

It is possible to move to another location before selecting "OK"; in fact, the Return to Ebon Hawk pop-up can be carried this way for as long as another menu doesn't interrupt it.  It will also persist through loading zones.

You can also Transit Back after using a Fast Lane to return to the area you Fast Laned from.

[section=Quicker Fast Lanes]

In certain situations, a Fast Lane can be performed without having to load a Transit Save first.  If you are in an area where fast transit is possible, and are about to move to an area where it is normally not, do the following:

1. Activate [AMG](d4jq8) (usually with a Quick Save)
2. Open the Map screen
3. Select Return to the Ebon Hawk and close the menu
4. Unpause the game and move to where you want to transit
5. Select "OK" to Return to the Ebon Hawk

This is faster than loading a separate save, but only situationally useful.  Most of the time, Unrestricted runs use several menu pop-ups, and thus the Return to Ebon Hawk pop-up usually cannot be preserved for long enough.

[section=Uses]

There are many uses of Fast Lane in a speedrun setting.  Currently, the main uses are:

1. Skipping Star Map cutscenes and easily leaving planets when done with them
2. Enabling a [Party Spawn Door Clip](dyi4i#ch2Party_Spawn_Door_Clips) into the Dantooine Ruins while in combat
3. Enabling the removal of the Envirosuit underwater on Manaan
