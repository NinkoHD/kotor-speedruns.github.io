All Star Maps Guide v1.0: Male/Female Scoundrel Route[/big]**[/center]

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible while obtaining all five individual Star Maps; Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black after Malak's death animation. A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the KotOR Speedrunning Discord which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com. There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

[section=Category Rules]

All Star Maps (ASM) uses the Unrestricted ruleset only; currently, neither the NMG nor Glitchless rulesets can skip a Star Map normally, so for those rulesets there would be no difference between Any% and ASM.

Thus any glitches are allowed, including the Routine; however, since you must activate each Star Map individually, currently the Routine is not used in this run.

[section=Route Overview]

**Run Setup**

This route skips Jedi training on Dantooine, instead using [Coordinate Warps](iarwc#ch4Coordinate_Warping) and [Save Teleports](5dagb) to move quickly.  There are five save slots necessary for this route; their general purpose is outlined here:
- *Slot 1: Active or Fast Lane*: This slot is used for temporary [Hotshot](iarwc) saves, as well as a [Fast Lane](imbom) save when needed.
- *Slot 2: Upper City North and Korriban*: This slot is used to save before entering the Sith Base on Taris and for multiple Korriban [Coordinate Warps](iarwc#ch4Coordinate_Warping).
- *Slot 3: Enclave and Ebon Hawk*: This slot is used to return to the Jedi Enclave after the Dantooine Star Map and multiple [Hotshots](iarwc) back to the Ebon Hawk.
- *Slot 4: Kashyyyk*: This slot is used for [Coordinate Warps](iarwc#ch4Coordinate_Warping) on Kashyyyk and the Star Forge.
- *Slot 5: Tatooine*: This slot is used to return to Tatooine at the end of the midgame.

Note the exact location of the saves doesn't really matter, but this order puts the most frequently used ones near the top.

[section=Character Build]

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference.  Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

**Character Creation: Initial Selections**

Str - 18
Dex - 14
Con - 14
Int - 8
Wis - 8
Cha - 10

Awareness - 4
Persuade - 4
Security - 4

Initial Feat: Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

**Leveling Plan:**

*Level 2: [Skele FLU](b6452)*

[Skele FLU](b6452) from 2 to 17:
- Master Two-Weapon Fighting
- Sneak Attack IX

No other level is used, since we don't engage in any combat after Gadon Thek on Taris.  The exception is Malak, but we just throw Thermal Detonators at him.

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* Max Strength aids our chance to hit with melee attacks for Taris.  Dex and Con are used for saving throws against stunning powers.  10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk.
- *Skills:* Persuade is used in a few places, to Persuade Yuthura, Lashowe, and the Manaan scientists in Kolto Control.  Security is the only necessary for a skip on Endar Spire that allows us to skip Trask.  Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but it's not really necessary.
- *Feats:* Master Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order.  Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons helps our chance to hit slightly.  We use Critical Strike as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

[section=Detailed Route]

*Before beginning, disable VSync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble [DLZ](f0aia) on Endar Spire.  This makes the [DLZ](f0aia) more consistent.*

> Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character
> Str to 18, Dex to 14, Con to 14, Cha to 10
> Awareness to 4, Persuade to 4, Security to 4
> Initial Feat: Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons
> Pick a good name!
> Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](t5kyf#ch3Hard_Buffers)!)

If you made it this far, congratulations! Thanks for reading the guide. Please let indykenobi or Lane know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact both is on Discord).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck, Lane, HotShotWire and the rest of the KotOR community for tossing around ideas and breaking this game so much that we can have an All Star Maps category that's different from Any%!

Extra shoutout to glasnonck for his Walkmesh Visualizer tool, which made plotting out the coordinate warps in the midgame possible without going insane.
