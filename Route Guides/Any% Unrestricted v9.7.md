Any% Guide v9.7: Male/Female Scoundrel Route [/big]**[/center]

[small]*Written by @Lane and @indykenobi *[/small]

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible; Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to @glasnonck and @XeroHR (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

[section=Guide Organization]

Because of the power of the Unrestricted Ruleset, this run skips a huge amount of the game. Thus, things like alignment, credit/equipment routes, and even character build are either completely irrelevant or only briefly important. Thus, this guide is instead organized into two main sections that each cover all of the necessary details for the route.

*1. Route Overview* - A general description of the speedrun route, highlighting key skips and glitches used.
*2. Detailed Route* - This section details the character build and route for the standard Scoundrel version of the speedrun, which uses a Skele FLU to obtain Sneak Attack IX and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.

[section=Route Overview]

**Run Setup**

The route uses the "Three Save Method", meaning the run will use the top three save slots in your game. These are typically labelled, in order, "Hotshot Current", "Teleport", "Fast Lane".
- "Hotshot Current" stores the active save that we will be running with and [Hotshotting](iarwc) around with.
- "Fast Lane" is used both as a Hotshot teleport location as well as a [Fast Lane](imbom) save.
- "Teleport" stores temporary locations that we will use to hotshot to in the future.

*NOTE: Many runners have began to use the "No Save Method", where you start the game with no save slots, and simply create a new save at each point a hard save is needed. Both methods are valid*

**Route Notation**

> indicates a level up to be done
} indicates an inventory/equipment action to be done
MC - Stands for Main Character, your player character
PC - Stands for any player controlled character (such as the MC or a party member)
CS - Cutscene
QS - Quick Save
QL - Quick Load
QS/QL - Quick Save then immediately Quick Load
AMG - [Anywhere Menu Glitch](d4jq8)
DLZ - [Displaced Load Zone](f0aia)
FLU - [Fake Level Up](b6452)
GP Warp - [Gather Party Warp](77xef)

*Conversation Note: If no conversation choices are specified, spamming clicks, NumPad Enter, and/or 1 will all work (this chooses all 1 options)*

[section=Character Build]

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference. However, Male PC has become the more common choice for [DLZ](f0aia) visual cues. Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

**Character Creation: Initial Selections**

Str - 8
Dex - 16/18
Con - 18/16
Int - 8
Wis - 10
Cha - 10

*The choice between 16 DEX/18 CON and vice-versa comes down to personal preference of runner*

Awareness - 4 (Optional)
Security - 4

Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting

**Leveling Plan:**

*Level 2: [Skele FLU](b6452)*

Skele FLU from 2 to 17:
- Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
- Sneak Attack IX

*Levels 3: Auto-Level (Optional)*

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* High DEX aids our chance to hit with ranged attacks for Taris. Dex and Con are used for survivability (if skipping Plot Armor). 10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk. 10 Wisdom reduces the risk of failing will saving throws
- *Skills:* Security is the only skill necessary for the run, and is used for a skip on Endar Spire. Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but it's not really necessary.
- *Feats:* IMproved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order. We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

[section=Detailed Route]

*Before beginning, disable VSync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble DLZ on Endar Spire. This makes the DLZ more consistent.*

> Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character
> Dex to 16/18, Con to 18/16, Wis to 10, Cha to 10
> Awareness to 4, Security to 4
> Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting
> Pick a good name!
> Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](t5kyf#ch3Hard_Buffers)!)

[DLZ](f0aia#ch4Command_Deck_to_Starboard_Section) into the Starboard Section through one of the following two methods:

- Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
- Open Buffer past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
- DLZ by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
---------------------------------------------------------
***Method Two: Doorframe DLZ***
*This strat is much easier, but slower than a good Rubble DLZ.*

---------------------------------------------------------
***Optional Strat: Plot Armor***
*This strat grants a minimum HP of 1 (called "Plot Armor" for short) for the rest of the run, but requires redoing the Spire DLZ and costs a minimum of 10 seconds (but likely more). The run can be done without it, but this strat provides a little safety if desired.*

Darth Malak Fight:
  - Throw Thermal Detonators with both MC and Bastila to defeat Malak's first phase
  - Be careful not to hit MC with Thermal Detonators, as they can only survive one or two
  - If you don't have plot armor the MC will almost certainly die after the second combat round
  - Just before the first phase ends, activate [AMG](d4jq8) via a QS
  - When you are given the first dialog option, press enter to simultaneously cancel the pop-up dialog and select the first conversation option
  - Immediately QS/QL to skip the CS
On loading, there will be a black screen. When the mouse disappears, the final death CS has begun and the run is over. Malak has been defeated once and for all, and you are now the Lord of the Sith (and you aren't even a Jedi!)

**Lane's Acknowledgements:**
Hopefully the route doesn't totally change again. Last time I updated this guide it only stayed accurate for about a day. I wanna thank @Sheepmetal and @wurwilf for getting me into this game, and @ChaosDrifting and @R4NG3 for proving to be real friends, and pushing this game to its limits.

**Indy's Acknowledgements:**
I'd like to acknowledge @glasnonck and @Thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as @glasnonck, @Lane, @hotshotwire and the rest of the KotOR community for tossing around ideas and breaking this game further. Additional shoutouts to @ChaosDrifting for helping me understand the Scoundrel Taris route.
