# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Quests No Major Glitches Guide 

### v1.0: Male Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi) and [BinksMagnus](https://www.speedrun.com/users/BinksMagnus)*

This route completes all 100 main and side quests in the game without the use of major glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and there are frequent load screens. 

Dark side or light side quest conclusions are chosen based on overall speed for the route.  This guide will cover the character creation and leveling choices, as well as reasoning for each quest's chosen completion and a detailed route.

If you need assistance with the glitches used in the game, I recommend the Techniques section of the [Glitch Guides](https://kotor-speedruns.github.io/kotor1/#glitch-guides).  You can either review those guides ahead of time, or use the hyperlinks in the guide below to consult the more detailed material when necessary.  You can also join the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu) and ask questions if you have them!

## Category Rules

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

### All Quests Category

For All Quests runs, you must complete the game with either ending on any difficulty, and complete all 100 quests. Completing a quest is defined as any of the following three conditions:

1. The quest appears in the "Completed Quests" section of the journal.
2. If the quest is entirely removed from the journal when completed, it must appear in the "Active Quests" section of the journal first.
3. If a quest is completed but then becomes active again, it must be completed again.

Out of the 100 quests, 91 of them can at some point be moved to the "Completed Quests" section of the Journal and thus satisfy condition 1.  

The quest "The Jedi Council" is (with the current route) the only quest that reactivates and thus falls under condition 3.  It is completed both times by satisfying condition 2, as the quest is never placed in the Completed Quests section of the Journal.  The following eight quests are removed entirely from the Journal instead of becoming Completed Quests, and thus must satisfy condition 2:
- Invited to a Party
- The Jedi Council (for both completions)
- The Ebon Hawk
- Sunry's Story
- Elora, Sunry's Wife
- Gluupor, the Rodian
- Ignus, the Hotel Owner
- Firith Me, the Pazaak Player

The final quest is the last one in the game, "The Final Confrontation".  The game actually never bothers to update that quest at any point after giving it to you, so for the purposes of the speedrun it is considered to be complete when Malak is defeated (when the timer stops).

### NMG Ruleset

## Character Build

### Character Creation

Male Scout - Choosing a Male character is faster in two places: starting the "Invited to a Party" quest on Taris requires going further into the Upper City Cantina as a Female MC, and you have to do 4 additional conversations with Carth to complete his quest.  This guide will assume a Male MC.

Scout is picked for automatic access to Flurry, Implant Level 2 and Computer Use as a Class Skill.

**Initial Attributes**
- 18 Str
- 12 Dex
- 12 Con
- 10 Int
- 8 Wis
- 12 Cha

**Initial Skills**
* Computer Use - 4
* Security - 1
* Treat Injury - 4
* Save the rest

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

The attribute spread maximizes damage while striking a balance between durability and utility.  18 Strength is to maximize our damage with melee weapons.  The points in Dexterity and Constitution are to give us some survivability.  The 10 Intelligence gives us enough skill points to invest points where we need to put them early on and still save enough to max out Persuade when we become a Jedi.  The 12 Charisma guarantees that we succeed at difficult Persuade checks while Force Valor is active.

For skills, we need will use Computer Use to help save on spikes throughout the run, Treat Injury to make our inevitable medpac use more effective, and Persuade to take some conversational shortcuts and finish some quests. Security helps optimize Endar Spire and lets the Main Character open some apartment doors while Carth kills stuff.

We choose Weapon Focus: Melee for the attack boost on Taris, in particular the fights with Selven, the Dueling Ring, and everything in the Sith Base. We choose it over Two-Weapon Fighting because it takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting. Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal, and since you only have one melee weapon equipped on the Endar Spire there is no additional point at which you would benefit from it by taking Two-Weapon Fighting at Creation.

### Leveling Plan

| Level | Feat | Power | Skills |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons, (Flurry) | | Com to 4, TI to 4, Sec to 1 |
| 2 | Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save all Skills |
| 3 | Empathy | | TI to 6 |
| 4 | (Implant 2, Uncanny Dodge) | | Save all Skills |
| 5 | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting | | Com to 8 |
| 6 | Improved Flurry, (Force Jump) | Burst of Speed, Force Valor | Save all Skills |
| 7 | | Affect Mind | Per to 10 |
| 8 | Master Two-Weapon Fighting | Dominate Mind | Per to 11 |
| 9 | | Knight Speed | Per to 12 |
| 10 | | Knight Valor | Per to 13 |
| 11 | Master Flurry, (Improved Force Jump) | Force Resistance | Per to 14 |
| 12 | Weapon Focus: Lightsaber | Drain Life | Per to 15 |
| 13 | | Energy Resistance | Per to 16 |
| 14 | Weapon Specialization: Lightsaber | Improved Energy Resistance | Per to 17 |
| 15 | | Master Speed | Per to 18 |

Our main plan is to combine Master Speed with Master Flurry and a Double-Bladed Lightsaber for five attacks per round in the late game.  Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus, stims and lightsaber crystals give us enough attack that we can reliably hit even with the attack penalties.

- We take Empathy at level 3 to gain a small boost to Persuade and Treat Injury; no other feat is as useful at that level.
- Implant Level 2 is granted for free at Level 4, allowing us to equip the Nerve Enhancement Package.
- We reach level 5 on Taris so that we can be as strong as possible for the Duel Ring sidequest after rescuing Bastila.  Level 6 is saved for when we become a Jedi so we can take Speed, Valor, and Affect Mind before leaving Dantooine.
- For Feats, we stack everything we can that improves our chance to hit; Master Flurry, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, and Weapon Focus/Specialization: Lightsaber are the key feats we get.
- Force Speed is the key to our combat build and early movement; Master Speed is critical to get as many attacks in as possible.
- Force Valor helps us out on pretty much every key fight starting with the Elite Sand People Warriors and going all the way up to Darth Malak.
- Force Resistance can be used on Star Forge to help protect against hostile Force Powers, particularly on Deck 2.
- Dominate Mind allows us to pass Persuade checks on Czerka guards on Kashyyyk and Lashowe on Korriban.  Affect Mind allows us to access Manaan, Tatooine and Kashyyyk without paying the docking fee, among other things.
- If you happen to reach Level 16 (which is unlikely without a lot of extra kills), the power to take is Master Valor.

For skills, the 10 points in Intelligence allow us to get up to 8 net Computer Use, saving 2 spikes per hacking with our MC.  6 in Treat Injury helps us preserve some medpacs and increases survivability. Persuade helps us shortcut some quests and bypass some fights, and we max this out as soon as we become a Jedi.  We keep putting points in Persuade because as we level because we need more Persuasion to continue to pass important Persuade checks.

## Equipment Plan

**Implant: Nerve Enhancement Package** - Bought on Taris, Zelka's Shop (500 Credits)
- A convenient source of Immunity: Mind-Affecting, protecting us from a host of Dark Jedi abilities and other status effects that slow us down.

**Head: Breath Mask** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (100 Credits)
- This cheap hat gives Immunity: Poison, which is convenient mostly for defending against the related Force powers from Dark Jedi.

**Gloves: GenoHaradan Power Gloves** - Received on Manaan from Hulas
- The reward for killing Ithorak, +4 Strength is only bested by the +5 Dominator Gauntlets, which cost way too much for the marginal upgrade.

**Body: Jedi Knight Robe** - Found on Dantooine, Nemo's corpse
- Easily accessible on the critical path, and good enough for our needs.

**Belt: CNS Strength Enhancer** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (8500 Credits)
- A belt that gives +2 Strength and +2 to all saving throws helps on both offense and defense.

**Weapon: Double-Bladed Lightsaber** - Found on Taris, Brejik's corpse
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the bulk of the game.  This allows us to use Force Jump, as well as maximize the effects of the Solari and Krayt Dragon Pearls that we place into it.  It's also free, which reduces the strain on the credit route quite a bit compared to the alternatives.
- Crystals Used:
    - Sigil Crystal: Placed after Dantooine 1, used for +1 Attack (and a small damage boost)
    - Krayt Dragon Pearl: Placed after Tatooine 1, gives a huge +3 Attack as well as +2 Energy damage
    - Solari Crystal: The best crystal in the game and the reason we want to be Light-aligned in endgame. Replaces Sigil after Lehon, gives +3 Attack, +3 Physical damage, and +1d8 damage vs. Dark Side enemies, which the final three major combat encounters happen to put us against.

## Credit Route

The major purchases made during the run are the CNS Strength Enhancer, HK-47, and a large amount of adrenal stims and medpacs for fights.  The credit route is extremely tight early on and stops being a concern after Manaan 1.

**1. Larrim on Taris**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 1276 Credits
- *Buy:* 2x Concussion Grenade and Battle Stimulant (≥1000 Credits)

**2. Zelka Forn on Taris**
- *Buy*: Nerve Enhancement Package, 5x Adrenal Alacrity, 5x Adrenal Strength, Medpacs

**3. Janice Nall on Taris**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 6400 Credits

**4. Crattis Yurkal on Dantooine**
- *Buy*: CNS Strength Enhancer, Breath Mask, 3x Adrenal Alacrity, 1x Adrenal Strength, 1x Adrenal Stamina, +/- Pazaak Cards

**5. Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu on Tatooine**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 4800 Credits
- *Buy*: Bantha Fodder, ~15x Advanced Medpacs

**6. Junix Nard on Tatooine**
- *Buy*: Pazaak Cards (3650 Credits)

**7. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
- *Sell*: Racing Bonds to reach about 4500 Credits
- *Buy*: 7x Parts, 5x All Hyper Stims (≥500 Credits)

**8. Eli Gand on Kashyyyk**
- *Buy*: ~20x Advanced Medpac

**9. Czerka Store on Korriban**
- *Buy*: All Echani and Hyper Stims, Medpacs if needed

Notice that we sell as much as possible to Janice Nall on Taris; shops on Taris give 40% of item value for sell prices, compared to 25% off of Taris, so we maximize our credits that way.

In addition to selling items, other major sources of credits include:
- Duel Ring rewards
- Taris Bounty and Rakghoul Serum rewards
- Manaan Swoop Races

## Alignment Route

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are Dark. Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High). The player character can be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light. The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

### Alignment Shifts

Here's the full list of alignment actions that happen during the run; there are 46 total shifts, of which exactly 27 are dark and 16 are light:

| Aligned | Action | Type | Delta | New |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neutral | Game Start | -- | 50 | 50 |
| Neutral | Threaten Dia about Holdan | Low Dark | -2 | 48 |
| Neutral | Kill Dia | Low Dark | -2 | 46 |
| Neutral | Kill Largo | Low Dark | -2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Kill the Infected Outcasts | Low Dark | -2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Give Rukil the Promised Land journals | High Light | +6 | 48 |
| Neutral | Agree to a death match with Bendak Starkiller | Low Dark | -2 | 46 |
| Neutral | Threaten Ajuur for more credits | Low Dark | -2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Threaten Janice Nall for T3 | Low Dark | -4 | 40 |
| Neutral | Sell the Rakghoul Serum to Zax | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |
| Dark | Threaten Yuka Laka for HK-47 | Low Dark | -1 | 37 |
| Dark | Kill Tanis | Mid Dark | -2 | 35 |
| Dark | Kill Komad Fortuna | Low Dark | -1 | 34 |
| Dark | Order Sasha off your ship | Mid Dark | -2 | 32 |
| Dark | Lie to Nubassa about the gizka | Low Dark | -1 | 31 |
| Dark | Kill Lorgal via the console | Low Dark | -1 | 30 |
| Dark | Loan Queedle money for his swoop bike | Mid Light | +6 | 36 |
| Dark | Try to refuse Queedle's return of the loan | Low Light | +4 | 40 |
| Neutral | Give Casus's journal to Nurik for free | Low Light | +2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Refuse reward from Shen and Rahasia | Low Light | +2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Kill Zuulan | Low Dark | -2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Kill Rulan | Low Dark | -2 | 40 |
| Neutral | Kill Freyyr | High Dark | -6 | 34 |
| Dark | | Low Dark | -1 | 33 |
| Dark | Kashyyyk Star Map Quiz | Low Light | +4 | 37 |
| Dark | | Low Dark | -1 | 36 |
| Dark | Report Freyyr's death to Chuundar | High Dark | -4 | 32 |
| Dark | Tell Matton not to kill Eli | High Light | +8 | 40 |
| Neutral | Buy Sharina's wraid plate for half price | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |
| Dark | Kill Vorn | Low Dark | -1 | 37 |
| Dark | Kill Ithorak | Low Dark | -1 | 36 |
| Dark | Persuade Yuthura to let you join the Sith Academy | Low Dark | -1 | 35 |
| Dark | Persuade Kel Algwinn to return to the Jedi | Hardcoded | +3 | 38 |
| Dark | Use serum on the Mandalorian prisoner | Hardcoded | -3 | 35 |
| Dark | Use serum on the Mandalorian prisoner again | Hardcoded | -3 | 32 |
| Dark | Give Dustil evidence of Uthar's betrayal | High Light | +8 | 40 |
| Neutral | Disable assassination protocol in rogue droid | Mid Light | +4 | 44 |
| Neutral | Give dark answers during Jorak Uln's quiz | Mid Dark | -4 | 40 |
| Neutral | Spare Yuthura Ban | Mid Light | +4 | 44 |
| Neutral | | Low Light | +2 | 46 |
| Neutral | Remain true to the Light Side on Lehon | High Light | +6 | 52 |
| Neutral | | Highest Light | +10 | 62 |

The alignment route is quite lenient, since we no longer try to equip the Solari crystal until after Lehon, when we get a massive infusion of light side points when we choose to renounce our former identity.

The ending for the run is the light side ending; see below.

### Quest Alignment Choices

In general, every quest outcome is chosen to get the fastest time, regardless of alignment. Some notes on some non-intuitive choices:

**1. Dia's Bounty - Dark**
- We kill Dia on Taris because it's faster than Persuading Holdan to drop the bounty, since you'd have to talk to Zax twice in that case, then Transit Back and talk to Dia.

**2. The Promised Land - Light**
- Giving Rukil the Promised Land journals is faster because you must give him the apprentice's journal, and you can turn in the other journals in the same conversation.  We also don't need Igear's pitiful credit reward.

**3. Rakghoul Serum - Dark**
- Selling the Rakghoul Serum to Zax is faster than visiting Zelka a second time or delaying his shopping trip, since we have to talk to Zax anyway for the bounty quests and delaying the Adrenal Alacrity we get from Zelka would make Taris much slower overall.

**4. Tanis Trapped - Dark**
- Killing Tanis is faster than solving the droid puzzles to save him.

**5. A Desert Hunt - Dark**
- We kill Komad to avoid having to talk to him later, and for a second Krayt Pearl, as this allows us to use one in our lightsaber and the second for the quest Worthy of History.

**6. Manaan Swoop Races - Light**
- Loaning Queedle money before doing the Manaan Swoop Races saves time because otherwise you're forced to talk to Huxta Jax between the second and third swoop races.

**7. Mission for the Republic - Neutral**
- We save the Mother Firaxan on Manaan because killing her locks us out of both the Republic Hiring Mercenaries and the Missing Selkath sidequests; it is also just barely slower than killing her.

**8. A Chieftain in Need - Dark**
- We kill Freyyr because it's faster overall for a variety of reasons. We avoid having to kill the Ritual Beast, we avoid having to fight Chuundar and his lackeys, Gorwooken will take us straight to Chuundar as we exit the Shadowlands, and we avoid having to complete Wookiee Lost the normal way as it auto-completes instead when Chuundar kicks us out of the village.

**9. Star Map: Kashyyyk - Dark** 
- We give the "correct" answers during the Star Map quiz on Kashyyyk because it's faster than giving Light Side answers and having to fight the Defense Droids.  Ironically, because we have Dark alignment while this is happening and the second answer causes a Light Side shift, this entire conversation results in a net Light Side shift of +2 despite the fact that we're giving mostly "Dark Side" answers.

**10. Korriban Sidequests and Prestige** 
- Many of the Korriban choices are made because we can only turn in five prestige points before Uthar stops accepting other quests.  Choosing the Dark Mandalorian Weapons Cache, Light Doubting Sith, Neutral Ajunta Pall's Sword, and Light Rogue Droid allows those sidequests to be completed without talking to Uthar; this leaves only five quests (Code of the Sith, Hermit in the Hills, Renegade Sith, Aiding Lashowe, and Double-Double Cross) that require getting a prestige point from Uthar.  The only other possibility is Light Renegade Sith and Dark Rogue Droid, but that requires killing the terentatek at the back of the Shyrack Caves, which is too far out of the way.

**11. Finding Dustil - Light** 
- Choosing to give Dustil the evidence of Uthar's treachery is just barely slower, but prevents having to fight him, and we have to go into Uthar's Room anyways.

**12. Hermit in the Hills - Dark** 
- Choosing the Dark Hermit in the Hills completion is faster and prevents having to fight Jorak Uln, who's actually kind of a pain.

**13. Middleman - Dark**
- We give Sharina half the credits she asks for because it's faster to mash through the cutscene than it is to select dialogue.

**14. Trapped on a Nameless World - Light**
- We stay true to the Light Side on Lehon because otherwise the "Juhani" quest does not complete.  It also makes the Star Forge faster in the NMG rule set, since we would otherwise have to bring Bastila through the Star Forge with us.

## Route Overview

### Planet Route

Taris -> Dantooine 1 -> Tatooine 1 -> Manaan 1 -> Dantooine 2 -> Kashyyyk -> Tatooine 2 -> Manaan 2 -> Leviathan -> Korriban -> Unknown Planet -> Star Forge

Some planets require at least two visits, such as:
- Manaan: You must visit to trigger the GenoHaradan quests, then leave to kill the targets, then return to finish them.
- Dantooine: The Zuulan bounty for the GenoHaradan is here, and can only be done on a second visit.

Planets that can be done in a single visit include:
- Korriban: Korriban does not require two visits if you get its Star Map last, since then you can do the Premium Merchant quest at that time.  The Premium Merchant quest is only available after the Leviathan.
- Kashyyyk: Kashyyyk can be done in one visit, as long as you visit Manaan first to trigger the GenoHaradan bounty for Rulan.

Tatooine could be done in a single visit if our route was different, but since we visit it first it's not possible.
- We don't visit Manaan first because ideally we'd like to have already encountered Senni Vek to start the GenoHaradan quest with Hulas, which we need two Star Maps (including the one on Dantooine) to do.
- We don't visit Kashyyyk first because it would require a second visit to kill Rulan.
- We don't visit Korriban first because we would need to revisit for the Premium Merchant quest and for Dustil, who won't appear until you've been approached by Jordo. Some of the combat encounters here would also be quite difficult.

This route does not visit Yavin space station, and therefore does not get the Baragwin Assault Blade or the Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Mask.  But we save time by not having to visit Suvam three times.

## Detailed Route

This section will describe all the actions you'll need to take for the All Quests NMG run.

### Crash Awareness

KotOR has a significant memory leak associated with the Quick Save feature, which is used heavily in this speedrun and is what allows a significant portion of NMG's glitches to work. It is recommended to speedrun with the Task Manager open in order to monitor Memory usage and also to close the game at several points. It is recommended to close and restart the game around 1400-1450 MB of memory used, as the game will crash unpredictably between 1500 and 1600 MB. This is a very small margin, and being aware of your memory usage is a vital component of finishing runs and getting good times.

  - *Breath Mask*
  - *GenoHaradan Power Gloves*

  - *CNS Strength Enhancer*
  - *Double-bladed Lightsaber*
- `Auto-Level Carth and Bastila`
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) past a Canderous CS
- Take the elevator to the command deck: 2

**Command Deck:**

*In the bridge section, you have to keep Carth and Bastila close to you in order to leave through the Bridge Storage door. Do your best to make sure they don't wander off, as that can and will lose you a lot of time. You can choose to manually save and reload that save; this sometimes helps.*

- Turn right, then left, killing Sith Troopers as needed to make Carth and Bastila follow you
- Open second door on left
- Bash open Armory door on far side of this room
- Loot the Space Suit on the far side of the Armory
- Safety save in the first room before opening door
- Open door on the far side of the hall and run through, bash open the door, and go through
  - If MC gets stunned or debuffed, QL to avoid Duration Glitched negative status effects
- Open the Inner Airlock Door
- Spacewalk Skip:
  - Move so that the outer airlock door is targeted
  - Click to open and immediately QS once
  - QL and you should spawn with the airlock open and no Space Suit
- Reach the far airlock
- *Force: Cast Knight Speed, Cast Burst of Speed with Bastila, Hyper Alacrity on Carth*
- Activate Solo Mode
- Have Carth and Bastila go through the door on the right
  - Tuck them in the corner to attempt to deaggro them
  - The goal is to have them stay close enough to the exit while you do Saul Karath skip
- Swap back to MC and run up to bridge door
- Saul Karath Skip
  - Before attempting, you may want to make a hard save for safety; you can softlock here.
  - This trick is a save buffer, but the timing is quite precise
  - Open Bridge Door and QS twice
  - Load immediately
  - If the trick works, the bridge door will be open, the fight will not start, and Bastila and Carth will be in your party.
  - If Bastila and Carth are not in your party, you've softlocked.
  - If your last QS was too late, your game will crash when you load.
- Once successful, hack bridge terminal: 1,2
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the exit
  - Bastila and Carth may be dead; if they’re still on the farther half of the room that’s fine
  - If they died closer to the bridge, you’ll have to kill the five soldiers
- *Heal: Medpac party as needed*
- *Force: Cast Knight Speed with MC*
- Kill the Sith Soldier nearby to the left
- QS/QL to get party to follow
- Take left path and loop around outside back to elevator
  - If you are quick, it's possible to skip killing the two guards right outside the elevator
  - If either Carth or Bastila aggros on them, you'll likely have to kill them
  - Or you can use Solo Mode and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to try to get everyone into the elevator
- Take the elevator to the Hangar: 3

## Korriban

*Note: From here through Lehon, your [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) may be too large and unwieldy to use effectively.  Casting Knight Speed will make it easier to control them but reduce the distance they cover, so use Speed sparingly and only in tight quarters.*

  - Jagi's 2nd convo: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2
    - You have to finish this conversation before Jagi walks out of range or the conversation will end early and the quest won't complete
    - ***Finishes “Jagi’s Challenge”***
