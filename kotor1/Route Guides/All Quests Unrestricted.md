# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Quests Unrestricted Guide 

### v4.0: Male Scoundrel -> Jedi Guardian Route

*Route by @indykenobi, with help from @R4NG3 and @ChaosDrifting*

*Guide by @indykenobi*

This route completes all 100 main and side quests in the game with no restrictions. Dark side or light side conclusions are chosen based on overall speed for the route. This guide will cover the character creation and leveling choices, as well as reasoning for each quest's chosen completion and a detailed route.

If you need assistance with the glitches used in the game, I recommended the Major Glitch and Technique guides.  You can either review those guides ahead of time, or use the hyperlinks in the guide below to consult the more detailed material when necessary.  You can also join the KotOR Speedrunning Discord and ask questions if you have them!

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

[section=Character Build]

***Character Creation
---------------------------***

Choosing a male character is faster in two places: starting the "Invited to a Party" quest on Taris requires going further into the Upper City Cantina as a female MC, and you have to do 4 additional conversations with Carth to complete his quest.  This guide will assume a male MC.

Scoundrel is picked for access to Sneak Attack, which is a key part of our combat build.

**Initial Attributes**
18 Str
8 Dex
14 Con
8 Int
14 Wis
10 Cha

Our attributes are chosen here for two reasons: 18 Strength is to maximize our damage and melee weapons for maximum damage. The points in Constitution and Wisdom are to increase the corresponding saving throws, while the 10 in Charisma opens up a couple extra Persuade checks on Kashyyyk, and gives us one extra net Persuade point.

**Initial Skills**
Persuade - 4
Security - 4
Save the rest

Security is used for a skip on Endar Spire, as well as opening Selven's apartment on Taris. Persuade is our main skill and what we will be dumping points into during the [Fake Level Ups](b6452) (or FLUs) later on in the run, so that we can take some conversational shortcuts.

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons gives us a +1 on our combat rolls with melee weapons, translating to every attack having an additional 5% chance to hit.  Since actually hitting is the only thing that can hold back our combat build, we need every bit of extra attack we can get.

***Leveling Plan
-------------------***

It is important to note that, due to the side effects of [Hotshots](iarwc), our character frequently reverts to a previous level.  Hence for most of Taris we are level 2, and generally stay at level 5 or 6 until Korriban.

https://i.imgur.com/va8K9X2.png

There are multiple [FLUs](b6452) in the five levels we do manually:
- At Level 2, we do the [Sneak Attack FLU](b6452#ch9Sneak_Attack_FLU) to get Sneak Attack IX and Master Two-Weapon Fighting, as well as 10 Persuade.
- At Level 4, we do the [Master Speed FLU](b6452#ch10Master_Speed_FLU) to get Master Critical Strike and Master Speed, and bump our Persuade to 12.
- At Level 5, we do the [Master Valor FLU](b6452#ch11Master_Valor_FLU) to get Weapon Focus: Lightsaber and Master Valor, and bump our Persuade to 14.

Additional Notes:
- We choose Master Critical Strike over Master Flurry because our weapons have a high base chance to crit, so the damage potential is higher with Critical Strike despite getting one fewer attack per round.
- Another reason to choose Critical Strike over Flurry is our relatively low chance to hit.  Even with Master Two-Weapon Fighting and both Weapon Focuses, we have a lower chance to hit due to our persistently low level.  Avoiding the to-hit penalty of Flurry is important in this context.
- Our Force Powers are fairly straightforward; Affect Mind is actually skippable, but it does have minor benefits and selecting it keeps our Force Power menus as clean as possible.
- 14 Persuade, 10 Charisma, and Master Valor are enough to guarantee all Persuade checks for the entire run, since we max out at level 10.

[section=Equipment Plan]

**Head: Breath Mask** - Bought from Crattis Yurkal, Dantooine
- Gives us Immunity: Poison, which is protection against the Force powers Slow, Affliction and Plague.

**Gloves: Strength Gauntlets** - Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- These basic gloves give us +1 Strength and are equipped after Taris.  They bring our Strength without stims to 20, bumping our strength mod to +5 (without stims) for the entire midgame.
**Gloves: GenoHaradan Power Gloves** - Received on Manaan from Hulas
- The reward for killing Ithorak, +4 Strength is only bested by the Dominator Gauntlets, which cost way too much for the marginal upgrade.  These are equipped on the Leviathan for Korriban and the endgame.

**Body: Sith Armor** - Found on Taris, Sarna's backpack
- Functionally equivalent to a Jedi Knight Robe, we get this for plot reasons and a neat exploit on Manaan.

**Belt: Adrenaline Amplifier** - Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- This belt helps our Reflex save a little in the midgame.  It's the most useful belt we come across on Taris, which isn't saying much.
**Belt: Nerve Amplifier Belt ** - Found on Tatooine, Chewed Twi'Lek corpse
- This gives us Immunity: Mind-Affecting, further solidying our defense against the ways of the Sith.

***Weapons Used
-------------------***

**1. Vibrosword** - Purchased on Taris, 132 Credits
- This is better than a vibroblade on Taris, and we use its purchase from Larrim to trigger the Credit Underflow glitch so we can buy sufficient stims for the Duel Ring.
*Equipped: Mainhand (Taris)*

**2. Prototype Vibroblade** - Found on Endar Spire, Sith Commander corpse
- A slightly improved vibroblade, it's readily available, free, and as a balanced offhand weapon helps our chance to hit throughout Taris.
*Equipped: Offhand (Taris)*

**3. Sanasiki's Blade** - Purchased on Dantooine, 7000 Credits
*Equipped: Mainhand (Dantooine), Offhand (Kashyyyk through Star Forge)*
- This is the best melee weapon we have early access to without venturing to Yavin. When fully upgraded, this has a 50% chance to crit with Master Critical Strike, and serves as a balanced offhand weapon.  It's in the mainhand on Dantooine so we get three attacks with it through Master Speed; after Dantooine we have enough crystals for the Lightsaber to be preferred in the mainhand.

**4: Lightsaber** - Built on Dantooine during Jedi Trials
*Equipped: Offhand (Dantooine), Mainhand (Kashyyyk through Star Forge)*
- Since we now skip the Ritual Beast on Kashyyyk, the lightsaber we build during our training is our main weapon for the rest of the game.  We'll add a Sigil Crystal and a Krayt Dragon Pearl to boost our damage, but more importantly our attack.  Having this also enables Force Jump for the entire game.


[section=Credits Route]

Overall the credit route is quite lenient; there are at least 1000 credits extra at the tightest point after Taris.  There are also only two complicated shopping trips; the first is with Larrim when we use Credit Underflow to go negative, while the second is selling many duplicated items to Janice Nall.

**1. Larrim on Taris (Credit Underflow)**
*Sell*: 2 Vibroblades, Ion Blaster
*Buy*: Vibrosword, Vibroblade, Confirm Vibrosword (-76 Credits left)
*Buy*: Battle Stimulant (-186 Credits left)

**2. Zelka Forn on Taris**
*Buy*: 6x Adrenal Alacrity, 7x Adrenal Strength (-836 Credits left)

**3. Igear on Taris**
*Buy*: Vibration Cell (102 Credits left)

**4. Janice Noll on Taris**
*Keep*: All Computer Spikes, 13 parts, 1 Strength Gauntlets, 1 Adrenaline Amplifier, All Stims, 1 Energy Projector, 1 Durasteel Bonding Alloy, 1 Vibration Cell
*Sell*: Everything Else (11830 Credits left)

**5. Crattis Yurkal on Dantooine**
*Buy*: Sanasiki's Blade, Breath Mask, +/-3, +/-5 (4530 Credits left)

**6. Eli Gand on Kashyyyk**
*Buy*: Hyper Battle Stimulant, Hyper-Adrenal Strength (5830 Credits left)

**7. Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu on Tatooine**
*Buy*: Bantha Fodder (5829 Credits left)

**8. Junix Nard on Tatooine**
*Buy*: All Paazak Cards
*Note*: The fastest way to do this also involves buying the Hair Trigger that's in the middle, which we can and do afford (3859 Credits left)

**9. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
*Buy*: 5x Hyper Battle Stimulant, 5x Hyper Adrenal Strength (2109 Credits left)

Our main sources of credits are selling items to Janice, which is most of our twice-duplicated inventory.  We also use credits from quest rewards, particularly the Taris Duel Ring, Dantooine sidequests and the Manaan Swoop Races.

[section=Route Overview]

***Planet Route
-------------------***
Taris -> Dantooine -> Kashyyyk -> Tatooine 1 -> (Manaan 1 -> Tatooine 2 -> Manaan 2) -> Leviathan -> Korriban -> Unknown Planet -> Star Forge

The planets in parentheses are traveled between using [Hotshots](iarwc); Tatooine 2 includes several cleanup [Hotshots](iarwc), which start on Tatooine and warp to Manaan, Kashyyyk, Tatooine, and Manaan again in quick succession.  Both Leviathan and Korriban include a side trip to parts of Manaan to cleanup some quests.

The GenoHaradan sidequests are the main routing constraint in the midgame.  These sidequests alone give the following restrictions:
- Before visiting Manaan, you must trigger the GenoHaradan quests by getting either the Kashyyyk, Tatooine, or Korriban maps and then visiting Senni Vek on that planet.
- Manaan always requires two visits, as you must visit to trigger the Genoharadan quests, then leave to do them, then return to finish them.
- You must visit Dantooine twice to kill Zuulan, *or* visit Hulas after finishing the Leviathan and setting the flag for Dantooine to be destroyed.  We choose to set the Dantooine destroyed flag.
- While it was once thought that you must visit Tatooine to confront Hulas after turning in all the bounties, you can instead not challenge him and finish the quest on Manaan.

Other planet route notes:
- Korriban does not require two visits if you get its Star Map last, since then you can do the Premium Merchant quest at that time. The Premium Merchant quest is only available after the Leviathan.
- Kashyyyk could be done in one visit if done after Manaan 1; however, skipping Rulan lets us reach the Lower Shadowlands more quickly, and there is a convenient [Coordinate Warp](iarwc#ch7Coordinate_Warping) to go back for Rulan from the Manaan Sith Base.
- Tatooine could be done in one visit if done after Manaan 1; however, it is faster to visit Senni Vek on Tatooine, even though we do Kashyyyk first.  Senni Vek is quite out of the way on Kashyyyk.

[section=Detailed Route]

A full route of all actions to take to complete the run follows.  First, some general notes:

**Save File Notes:**
- *This run should start with no saved games at all.*  Saving in a new slot is slightly faster, and for one strat we *MUST* save in a new slot to avoid breaking a [Fast Lane](imbom).
- All necessary Hard Saves are noted in **bold**, along with the slot to save in.  Most saves will be in new slots, particularly after Kashyyyk.  
- When performing a [Hotshot](iarwc), you can always save in the first slot, with one noted exception on Taris at the start.
- This route ends up using **19** total save slots.

**Quest Notes:**
- It is generally noted where a quest begins and finishes. If it finishes at the same time it begins, it is only noted as "Finished". 
- Notes that read "Bastila #1" or similar are steps in conversation side quests with that particular party member. With a few noted exceptions, these are all spammable conversations.

**Conversation Notes:**
- If no conversation choices are specified, spamming will work.

- When the announcer stops laughing, QS *four times* to start the duel
- Attack with one Critical Strike, then immediately run towards Bendak
- He will hopefully try to move out of the way with blasters still equipped; Sneak Attack him again and he will hopefully fall for the ideal two-round fight
- If he shoots you instead, keep trying to bump him to keep him moving, or he'll equip his melee weapons
- If he equips his melee weapons, you lose the +10 attack bonus from Melee vs. Ranged; try to avoid this at all costs, as the fight then becomes very difficult to win
- Use medpacs if necessary, though Bendak can one-shot you or stun you if you're unlucky
- Finishes "The Duel Ring"
