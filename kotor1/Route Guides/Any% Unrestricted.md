# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - Any% Unrestricted Guide

**v9.7: Male/Female Scoundrel Route**

*Written by [Lane](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Lane) and [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible; Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Unrestricted Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

Any% Unrestricted is the fastest speedrun in KotOR I speedrunning, eclipsed only by KotOR II Any% Unrestricted.

All glitches are allowed in Unrestricted; however, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:
- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one's monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way 

## Guide Organization

Because of the power of the Unrestricted Ruleset, this run skips a huge amount of the game. Thus, things like alignment, credit/equipment routes, and even character build are either completely irrelevant or only briefly important. Thus, this guide is instead organized into two main sections that each cover all of the necessary details for the route.

*1. Route Overview* - A general description of the speedrun route, highlighting key skips and glitches used.  
*2. Detailed Route* - This section details the character build and route for the standard Scoundrel version of the speedrun, which uses a Skele FLU to obtain Sneak Attack IX and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.

## Route Overview

### Save Setup

The route uses the "Three Save Method", meaning the run will use the top three save slots in your game. These are typically labelled, in order, "Hotshot Current", "Teleport", "Fast Lane".
- "Hotshot Current" stores the active save that we will be running with and [Hotshotting](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) around with.
- "Fast Lane" is used both as a Hotshot teleport location as well as a [Fast Lane](../Major%20Glitches/Fast%20Lane) save.
- "Teleport" stores temporary locations that we will use to hotshot to in the future.

*NOTE: Many runners have began to use the "No Save Method", where you start the game with no save slots, and simply create a new save at each point a hard save is needed. Both methods are valid*

**Route Outline**

## Character Build

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference. However, Male PC has become the more common choice for [DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone) visual cues. Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

### Character Creation

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 8
* Dex - 16/18
* Con - 18/16
* Int - 8
* Wis - 10
* Cha - 10

The choice between 16 DEX/18 CON and vice-versa comes down to personal preference of runner; 18 DEX gives you a slightly better chance to hit Gadon and the Sith Governor, while 18 CON gives you slightly more survivability in the Sith Base on Taris and during the final fight with Malak.  If you do the Plot Armor glitch on Endar Spire, you should take 18 Dex, 14 Con, 14 Wis, and 10 Cha instead.

**Initial Skills:**
* Security - 4
* Awareness - 4 (Optional, can help spot mines)

**Initial Feat:** - Two-Weapon Fighting

### Leveling Plan

- *Level 2: [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to obtain:*
  - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
  - Sneak Attack IX
- *Level 3: Auto-Level (Optional; gives slightly more Vitality for the Malak fight)*

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* High DEX aids our chance to hit with ranged attacks for Taris. Dex and Con are used for survivability (if skipping Plot Armor). 10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk. 10 Wisdom reduces the risk of failing will saving throws
- *Skills:* Security is the only skill necessary for the run, and is used for a skip on Endar Spire. Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but it's not really necessary.
- *Feats:* IMproved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order. We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

## Endar Spire

*Before beginning, disable V-Sync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble DLZ on Endar Spire. This makes the DLZ more consistent.*

### Character Creation
- Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character  
- Dex to 16/18, Con to 18/16, Wis to 10, Cha to 10  
- Awareness to 4, Security to 4  
- Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting  
- Pick a good name!  
- Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#hard-buffers)!)  


### Command Module

- [Hard Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#hard-buffers) to skip the intro CS  
- [DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone#endar-spire-dlz) into the Starboard Section through one of the following two methods:
  - ***Method One: Rubble DLZ***
    - *This strat is potentially 20 seconds faster, but the DLZ is marginally harder.  This is the recommended method.*
    - Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
    - [Open Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#open-buffers) past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
    - DLZ by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
  - ***Method Two: Doorframe DLZ***
    - *This strat is much easier, but significantly slower than a good Rubble DLZ.  Recommended only for brand-new runners.*
    - Loot footlocker
    - *Equip MC: Short Sword*
    - Open door and Talk to Trask twice
    - *Equip Trask: Blaster Pistol Offhand*
    - [Open Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#open-buffers) to use Security during the Carth CS
    - Kill first two Sith with Trask's Power Blast and open next door
    - DLZ by walking into the right side of the door frame in the right spot

### Starboard Section

- ***Optional Strat: Plot Armor***  
  - *This strat grants a minimum HP of 1 (called "Plot Armor" for short) for the rest of the run, but requires redoing the Spire DLZ and costs a minimum of 10 seconds (but likely more). The run can be done without it, but this strat provides a little safety if desired.*
  - *To obtain Plot Armor:*
    - Hotshot back to Command Module to activate Plot Armor:
    - During (or after) the Carth CS, Hard Save to "Hotshot Current" slot
    - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) via QL (This way your QS remains in the Command Module)
    - Open Options, click "Exit Game", select both "OK" and "Save Game" simultaneously
    - Navigate down once in the main menu, and click Load Game
    - If the save name hasn't changed to "QUICKSAVE", click cancel, press up then down, and click Load Game again
    - Once the save name changes to "QUICKSAVE", load that save. Plot Armor is now active.
    - [DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone#endar-spire-dlz) into the Starboard Section again, using whatever method you used above  
  - *If you choose not to use the above strat:*
    - [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) during the load-in for the Starboard Section
    - Unpause/Cancel to begin moving to the next room while Carth narrates  
    - QS next to the footlocker to end the CS
- Loot footlocker in Terminal Room  
- Hack terminal console: 2,3  
- Carth accosts you
