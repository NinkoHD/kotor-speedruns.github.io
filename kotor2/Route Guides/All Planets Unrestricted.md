# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - All Planets Unrestricted Guide

### v1.1: 

All Planets (Unrestricted)
Route and Guide by [RedMage](https://www.speedrun.com/users/redmage08) and [30Cents](https://www.speedrun.com/users/30Cents)[/center]**

This route defeats Kreia on Malachor V as fast as possible, while obtaining every Force Form and visiting Master Vash to pay respects. Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when Kreia begins speaking after her final phase of battle. 
A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the detailed route for the run, as well as an alternate route for Citadel station, which is slower but skips a sub-pixelperfect glitch.


Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Unrestricted Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

All glitches are allowed in Unrestricted; however, all KotOR II speedruns ban the following:
- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one's monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way 



**Guide Key
-------------------------------**
- A dash will represent any general action. Like moving to a specific area. Casting a force power. Etc.
—- Three dashes in a row will represent more detailed information about the previous line of the guide
¤ This symbol represents a glitch to be performed.
—¤ Three dashes and a ¤ represents more detailed information on the glitch above it
> A greater than sign represents the level up
| A vertical bar represents a break in a conversation; you’d need to talk to that character for each set of numbers shown
÷ A division symbol represents a choice in route 

**Planet Route
-------------------------------**
Peragus -> Telos Station -> Telos Surface -> Korriban -> Nar Shaddaa -> Dxun ->Onderon -> Dantooine -> Malachor V				

**Conversation Notes
-------------------------------**
If no conversation choices are specified, spamming 1 and/or NumEnter will work.

**Character Creation
-------------------------------**
Female Sentinel or Consular - Quick Character
Character creation does not matter very much in this route. We utilize a glitch known as the development character which negates the need for much leveling up. We only do one real level up at the beginning of the game to get force speed, and the Jedi Guardian has to go through an extra menu. After that, all we do is auto-level characters.
