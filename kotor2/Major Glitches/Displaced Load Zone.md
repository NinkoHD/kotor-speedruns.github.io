[section=Description]

DLZ, or Displaced loading Zone, is a major glitch that has been known for many years. Until recently we have not been able to perform them intentionally, and we are still not entirely sure how it works. But thanks to community member **Lufex**, we now know enough about them to implement them in runs.
When a PC (Player-controlled Character) crosses certain bit-precise x-coordinate, they can activate a trigger that is in the positive y-direction from them. This allows for the triggering of area transitions, or cutscenes from a distance, under certain circumstances.

[section=How To]

The precise methods are difficult to describe without heavy visual aid. However, the process usually boils down to positioning your PC in a precise location, triggering the glitch.
- Position your PC, such that they are in the negative y-direction from the door or trigger area they wish to DLZ with
- Slowly move the PC, until their x-coordinate exactly aligns with one of the edges of the trigger area
- If the precise position was hit, a DLZ will occur.
As stated before, in order for the glitch to trigger, the PC must be in a precise position. Contrary to intuition, the logging of the PCs position is not continuous, but discrete, and is tied to the game's frame-rate. So by disabling V-sync (which increases frame-rate), this glitch may be easier to perform.
See the specific sections for exact positioning, and examples.
This process can be further facilitated by the use of Lufex's "Menu Method". In which one uses an AMG to acquire movement while a menu is open, significantly increasing the frame rate, and by-extension, the DLZ likelihood. Simply AMG, position the PC near where they should be, and set them up such that they'll slowly move into the DLZ spot, open a menu, unpause, and begin the movement.
