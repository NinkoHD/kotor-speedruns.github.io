[section=Description]

Anywhere Menu Glitch is a glitch that allows you to have limited control over your characters while in a menu screen or during a cutscene.  It is used to enable several major glitches in TSL, including:

- [Hotshot](y4rma)
- Fake Level Up
- Various Cutscene skips

[section=How To]

The Anywhere Menu Glitch is performed by pressing Alt-F4 during a saving or loading screen.  If loading, when the screen ends, the game can be unpaused by simply pressing the pause button. If saving, the player must open and close a menu, and then unpause. This allows you to move or perform other actions with the quit dialog still active.

[section=Uses]

* By starting a cutscene while an AMG is open, the player can select Cancel with the Enter Key during the cutscene. Doing this gives them rudimentary control on the PC. This also allows the player to Save and load the game, cancelling the cutscene.

* By activating another pop-up while the AMG is active, the AMG will be replaced with the pop-up, allowing full control of the game while that pop-up is active. We call this pop-up replacement.

* By pop-up replacing with the Exit Game button on the options menu, we can enter the main menu and the Save menu simultaneously. This allows us to load saves using the metadata from our quicksave. We call this a [hotshot](y4rma)

[section=Classic Menu Glitch]
The Classic Menu Glitch (sometimes called Container Menu Glitch) is an alternate way of triggering a menu glitch.  It is performed by standing next to a container and attempting to loot it.  Use any menu hotkey (such as Escape for Options) on the same frame that the item dialog pops up, and the item dialog should overlay itself on the menu screen.

If you open the menu too early, you can close it and attempt to open the menu again before the item dialog pops up.  In this way you can "buffer" a Menu Glitch.  If you open the menu too late, the item dialog will pop up as normal.  Just close it and loot the container to retry the glitch.

This method of performing a Menu Glitch predated the Anywhere Menu Glitch, but it is less reliable, less flexible, and slower than the Anywhere Menu Glitch.  Thus this version of Menu Glitch is now obsolete.
