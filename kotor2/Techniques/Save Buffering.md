## Description

Save Buffering is a method of cancelling triggers, including cutscenes, conversations and fights.  When Quick Saving, you will notice there's a short fade-in from black after the game finishes saving.  Triggers will not take effect during this fade in.  By moving forward while Quick Saving, you can enter a trigger and delay it using the fade-in.  You can then interrupt the trigger to cancel its effects.

## How To

In order to Save Buffer, stand in front of a trigger and hold both mouse buttons down to run forward.  Before reaching the trigger, press the Quick Save hotkey (by default, F4).  As the screen fades in, Quick Save again.  Repeat this until the fade-in effect no longer occurs; this means you have activated the trigger.  Continue Quick Saving until you are ready, then finish the buffer (see below).  If done correctly, you'll maintain control of your character and be able to continue normally.

In KotOR II, Hard Buffers are the only form of Save Buffer; Soft Buffers do not exist.

## Hard Buffers

A Hard Buffer is done by buffering into a trigger, then loading your last Quick Save before the trigger executes. 

### Via Load Menu

The recommended way to do a Hard Buffer is to use Quick Saves to enter a trigger, then open the Options menu using the icon in the top right corner. You can then manually load the last Quick Save to cancel the trigger. This method has the same effect and is more consistent, but requires extra menuing and can be slower without sufficient practice.

It can be tricky to open the menu while moving your character, so itâ€™s recommended to buffer into the trigger, stop moving, then open the menu, all while still buffering.

### Via Quick Load

This method can be inconsistent; depending on the cutscene and how long your Quick Saves take, the window for successfully Quick Loading can be quite small or even non-existent. This method requires practice and good timing (or good mashing).

## Uses

Save Buffers are used in all glitched speedruns to perform important skips, which will be listed here later.
