[section=Description]

Save Teleporting is a method of movement that employs a Quick Save, and allows you to teleport a variable amount of distance forward.  The distance teleported depends on how long it takes your game to save, which is affected by computer performance and how far into the game you are.

[section=How To]

To save teleport, simply hold both mouse buttons down to run forward, then press the Quick Save button.

Save Teleports become more effective as you get further into the game.  Generally speaking, they are ineffective on Peragus and Citadel Station. But later they can be quite powerful

*Important Note:* You will get more distance from a save teleport if Force Speed and Adrenal Alacrity are NOT active.  Sometimes it is better to let these buffs wear off and Save Teleport for movement, particularly later in the run.
